# Mini CRM – Full Stack MERN Application

## 📌 Project Overview

Mini CRM is a full-stack Customer Relationship Management (CRM) web application developed using the MERN stack.  
The application is designed to manage customer data efficiently by providing structured CRUD operations and a clean user interface for interaction.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete client-server architecture, RESTful APIs, and database integration.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Build a scalable full-stack web application
- Implement REST API communication between frontend and backend
- Manage structured customer data using MongoDB
- Apply modern frontend development practices with React (Vite)
- Understand backend routing, middleware, and database modeling

---

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

Frontend (React + Vite)  
⬇️  
Axios API Calls  
⬇️  
Backend (Node.js + Express)  
⬇️  
MongoDB Database  

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs.  
The backend handles business logic and interacts with MongoDB using Mongoose ODM.
